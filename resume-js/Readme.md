# General Requirements: All Project Types #

This project should feature user authentication (i.e., secure logins and passwords).
This app must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum of 25 commits.
Ideally, put your empty project up on GitHub on day one of development, and aim for multiple commits per day.
This app must be deployed somewhere.
The app should have a README.md file including what is referenced below in the application requirements.

# Application Requirements #
    Your back-end uses Python or Node.
    Your back-end uses Flask or Django (Python) or Express (Node).
    Your front-end may use React, or another front-end framework (e.g., Vue, Angular), or a template language (EJS, Pug, Handlebars).
    Your app must have a database that has at least two tables (SQL) or collections (Mongo).
    Your database must support at least one type of database relationship between tables/collections.
    This can be embedded or relational data in Mongo (An embedded collection will qualify as your second collection).
    This can be a 1:M (one-to-many) or N:M (many-to-many) relationship between SQL tables.
    Your app uses an ORM or ODM to interact with your database (e.g., Sequelize, PyMongo, SQLAlchemy, TypeORM, Mongoose).
    This app must run in a web browser.
    Your website should be responsive to screen size changes.
    This means that your website should be viewable and usable on a mobile device or tablet via an internet browser. Text shouldn't be super tiny and layouts shouldn't exceed the screen size on smaller screens.
    The app should have a README.md file including the following:
    Describes the inspiration for the application.
    Describes how to use the application.
    Lists the technologies used to build the application.
    Addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

# Deliverables #
